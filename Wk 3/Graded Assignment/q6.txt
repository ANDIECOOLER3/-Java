Consider the following abstract types.

• Scanner, with method scanDocuments().
• Printer, with method printDocuments().
• Copier, with methods scanDocuments() and printDocuments().

Identify the correct subtype and inheritance relationships between the classes. 

Scanner and Printer are subtypes of Copier
This would imply Scanner and Printer inherit from Copier, which is backward.


Copier is a subtype of Scanner and Printer .     Correct

Scanner and Printer both inherit from Copier.    Correct

Copier inherits from both Scanner and Printer
In Java, a class cannot inherit from multiple classes. 
If Scanner and Printer are interfaces, Copier implements them, not "inherits" them.
