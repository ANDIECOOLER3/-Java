which method overides parent class?

Method overriding occurs when:
A subclass defines a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in its superclass.
The method in the subclass provides a specific implementation of the method defined in the superclass.
The perimeter() method in Pentagon has the same name, return type (void), and parameters (no parameters) as the perimeter() method in Polygon. 
Therefore, it overrides the perimeter() method of the Polygon class.

The angleSum() method in Pentagon has a different parameter list (it takes an int x parameter) compared to the angleSum() method in Polygon (which has no parameters). 
Therefore, this is not method overriding. Instead, it is method overloading because the method name is the same but the parameter list is different.

Overriding: perimeter() in Pentagon overrides perimeter() in Polygon.
Overloading: angleSum(int x) in Pentagon overloads angleSum() in Polygon.
